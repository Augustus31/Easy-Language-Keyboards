# Easy-Language-Keyboards
A suite of Java applications designed to make typing in foreign languages much easier.

-------------------------------------

These apps are for use on Windows machines only (Macs already have easy special character support; just hold the key). Read the instructions text file in the zip for detailed instructions. 

Currently, only the Spanish language version is available. Expect more languages, such as Portuguese and French, to come soon.
