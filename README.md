# Easy-Language-Keyboards
A suite of Java applications designed to make typing in foreign languages much easier.

-------------------------------------

These apps are for use on Windows machines only (Macs already have easy special character support; just hold the key). Read the instructions.txt text file contained within the zip files for detailed instructions. 

Currently, the Spanish and Portuguese language versions are available. Expect more languages to be released in the future, such as French and German. 

## Why is this app better than the US International Keyboard? (or other special character setups)?

Here's why:
1. Easy Language Keyboards are set up to be, well, easy. Typing special characters doesn't require pressing shift, and can be done extremely quickly with minimal effort. 
2. There are no "dead" keys. You are free to use the ~, ^, `, and ' for other things. 
3. You type the letter first, and then turn it into a special character. This approach is more intuitive than typing a modifying symbol before the letter.
4. The app can be easily enabled or disabled with the press of a button.
